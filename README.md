## üåµDescription
 
</div>

My name is Thibaut and I'm a computer science professional with several years of experience in this field. I'm currently finishing my bachelor's degree and soon my master's degree. I'm passionate about developing scripts and applications for systems, networks and databases.

I will soon move to Canada to pursue my career and discover new opportunities. I am motivated to help the GitHub community by developing useful projects for users.

My readme reflects my skills, experience and commitment to software development and open source projects. You will find in my projects a particular attention to code quality and documentation, as well as a constant concern for improvement and innovation. Do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or if you want to collaborate on a project.
